# 👋 Hi, I’m **BreadedTuna**
### James — Student, Game Developer, Bug Bounty Tester

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I build multiplayer browser games, experiment with AI, work on security/pentesting projects, and sometimes post Minecraft stuff on YouTube. I’m always learning by creating.

---

## 🎮 My Main Project — **RM Cars**
An **online multiplayer racing game** built for the browser.

### 🌐 Live Versions
- **Main site:** https://rmcars.vercel.app  
- **GitHub Pages mirror:** https://breadedtuna.github.io/cars  
- **RM Cars Editor:** https://rmcarseditor.vercel.app  

### 🛠️ Background  
RM Cars started as a heavily-modded fork of **jchabin’s online racing game**(huge respect to jchabin), but over time I’ve:

- Doubled the codebase  
- Rewritten many core systems  
- Added host tools & admin features  
- Built new mechanics  
- Added new maps, modes, and UI  
- Expanded it into a full multiplayer experience  

At this point, RM Cars has become its **own standalone project**, far beyond the original prototype.

### 🚀 Long-Term Vision  
I want RM Cars to eventually become a **full platform**, similar to how Blooket gamified quizzes.

The long-term ideas:

- Teachers can create classrooms & homework sets  
- Checkpoints require answering questions correctly to pass  
- Up to 20+ students racing at once  
- Gamemodes like tag, hide & seek, elimination races, etc.  
- Player accounts with cosmetic cars and unlockables  
- An in-game currency + optional “RM Cars+” perks  
- A fun, anonymous, school-friendly replacement for tools like Blooket  

It’s ambitious, but very possible, in the far far future..

## 🕹️ Other Games & Stuff

### 🔥 **What Kills What**
https://whatkillswhat.vercel.app  
A fun old project that simulates battles between any two things using simple AI logic.  
One of my earliest browser game experiments.

### 🌠 **Make A Wish AI**
https://makeawishai.vercel.app  
Type a wish and the AI tries to “make it come true” visually using HTML animations.  
A kind of questionable project from years ago, still entertaining.
